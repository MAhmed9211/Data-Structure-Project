# Tree Base Suggestion System
This C++ program utilizes a tree data structure to implement a suggestion system, allowing users to input strings and receive suggestions based on the existing dataset. The system includes functionalities for loading data from a file, validating input, and providing suggestions.

# Tree Implementation
The program uses a tree data structure to efficiently store and retrieve strings. Tree nodes represent characters in strings, and the system efficiently manages suggestions based on user input.

# Features:

# String Insertion: 
Efficiently insert strings into the Tree data structure.
# Input Validation:
Validate user input to ensure it contains only lowercase alphabets.
# Data Loading:
Load strings from a file (outfile.txt) into the Tree for suggestion generation.
# Suggestions:
Provide suggestions based on user input.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites

C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
Basic understanding of C++ programming
